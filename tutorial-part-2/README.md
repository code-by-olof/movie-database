# SQL-Beginner Tutorial Part 2: Data Types and Designing a Database
Welcome back to Part 2 of my SQL Beginner Tutorial. Today, we’ll delve into data types and then proceed to design our first database together.

## Data Types in SQLite

Throughout this tutorial, I’ll primarily use SQLite. However, we’ll also take a short look on MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL.

SQLite has 6 different data types:
* **TEXT**: any string
* **NUMERIC**: non-decimal or decimal number
* **INTEGER**: non-decimal numbers (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4…)
* **REAL**: decimal numbers
* **BLOB**: Data is stored exactly as provided — SQLite does not attempt conversion to the column’s data type
* **NULL**: value is unknown or missing

Despite its data types, SQLite is a flexible dynamic type system, also known as type affinity. Essentially, it attempts to convert the provided data into the column’s data type if possible. To grasp this concept, let’s examine an example.


```
CREATE TABLE walking_dead (
    id INTEGER,
    first_name TEXT,
    last_name TEXT ,
    age INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

INSERT INTO walking_dead (first_name, last_name, age)
VALUES ("Rick", "Grimes", 37);

+------+------------+-----------+-----+
|  id  | first_name | last_name | age |
+------+------------+-----------+-----+
| 1    | Rick       | Grimes    | 37  |
+------+------------+-----------+-----+

INSERT INTO walking_dead (first_name, last_name, age)
VALUES
("Abraham", "Ford", "fourty-three");

+------+------------+-----------+--------------+
|  id  | first_name | last_name |     age      |
+------+------------+-----------+--------------+
| 1    | Rick       | Grimes    | 37           |
| 2    | Abraham    | Ford      | fourty-three |
+------+------------+-----------+--------------+

SELECT typeof(age) FROM walking_dead WHERE id = 1;
+-------------+
| typeof(age) |
+-------------+
| integer     |
+-------------+

SELECT typeof(age) FROM walking_dead WHERE id = 2;
+-------------+
| typeof(age) |
+-------------+
| text        |
+-------------+
```

Don’t worry. You don’t need to understand of all that yet. We cover that later! For now, let me explain what I did:

I created a table called ‘walking_dead’. ‘id’ has the data type INTEGER, ‘first_name’ and ‘last_name’ have the data type TEXT, and ‘age’ has the data type INTEGER. I then added a set of data with the correct (expected) data type. The second time I added data, I wrote the age as a string.
Then I added a set of data with the correct (expected) data type. The second time I added data, I wrote the age as a string.
In other databases, this would trigger an error, and the data wouldn't be added. However, SQLite attempts to convert the given data into an INTEGER. Since this isn't possible, it saves the data as they are.
To demonstrate that even better what happened to the data, I queried data type of ‘age’ in rows 1 and 2. As you can see, ‘age’ in row 1 is an INTEGER, as intended, but in row 2, it is of data type TEXT.

Let’s try something else.


```
INSERT INTO walking_dead (first_name, last_name, age)
VALUES ("Carl", "Grimes", "16");

SELECT typeof(age) FROM walking_dead WHERE id = 3;

+-------------+
| typeof(age) |
+-------------+
| integer     |
+-------------+
```

Again, I added an age as a string. But this time, the string is a number. Now SQLite succeeds in converting the given data into the column’s data type.

## SQLite STRICT MODE

If you need a more strict behaviour for your application, the STRICT MODE might be a solution for you. Let’s look how that works:

```
CREATE TABLE walking_dead (
    id INTEGER,
    first_name TEXT,
    last_name TEXT ,
    age INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
) STRICT;

INSERT INTO walking_dead (first_name, last_name, age)
VALUES ("Rick", "Grimes", "37");

+----+------------+-----------+-----+
| id | first_name | last_name | age |
+----+------------+-----------+-----+
| 1  | Rick       | Grimes    | 37  |
+----+------------+-----------+-----+

INSERT INTO walking_dead (first_name, last_name, age)
VALUES ("Carl", "Grimes", "sixteen");

Runtime error: cannot store TEXT value in INTEGER column walking_dead.age 
```
To create a table in STRICT MODE, we add the word STRICT while creating the table. I attempted to add Rick with his age written as a string, but still as a number. SQLite tried to convert it and succeeded. However, when I attempted to add Carl to the table, I encountered an error because the TEXT “sixteen” can’t be converted into an INTEGER.

Before we delve into the detailed process of designing a database, let’s explore data types in other SQL databases.

## Data Types in MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL

While MySQL defaults to STRICT MODE, both MariaDB and PostgreSQL can be set to STRICT MODE. All of them offer various data types for numeric values and string data types. Furthermore, they provide data types for date and time, as well as geometric types. Discussing all of these data types with examples would go beyond the scope of this tutorial.

## Designing a Database in SQLite

Before we design a database, it’s crucial to have a clear understanding of the purpose and requirements. We have to think about corner cases. Think about data, you might want to add in the future and keep that in mind when you plan the relations.

For this tutorial, we’ll design a movie database focusing on films shown in cinemas in 2019. Let’s outline some requirements for the database:

_You are to create a database that gives us on overview over all movies that were in the cinema in the year 2019. Every movie should have the following details: name, length, start date, director and rating. There should be a list of all box offices, national and international. All movies should have a list of the actors. It would be nice if we could see if an actor is a leading actor in a movie._

In my solution I will use 6 tables.
* movies
* actors
* directors
* box_office_results
* acting
* directing

The next step is to create am **ER (Entity Relationship) Diagram** visualizes the relations in your database and helps you to detect flaws. You don’t need to it digitally. It is totally ok, just to use pen and paper. I used the free Markdown tool Mermaid.

```mermaid
erDiagram              
    BOX_OFFICE_RESULTS {
        id INTEGER
        year INTEGER
        movie_id INTEGER
        national ROUND
        international ROUND
        rating REAL
    } 
    MOVIES {
        id INTEGER
        name TEXT
        year INTEGER
        start_date TEXT 
        length INTEGER
        rating REAL        
    } 
    

    DIRECTING {
        movie_id INTEGER 
        director_id INTEGER 
    }  

    DIRECTORS {
        id INTEGER
        first_name TEXT
        last_name TEXT
        birth_year INTEGER 
        birth_month INTEGER 
        birth_day INTEGER
    }     
    ACTING {
        movie_id INTEGER
        actor_id INTEGER
        type TEXT
    }
    
    ACTORS {
        id INTEGER
        first_name TEXT
        last_name TEXT
        birth_year INTEGER
        birth_month INTEGER
        birth_day INTEGER
    }   

    ACTING }o--o{ ACTORS : "can be in several movies"
    MOVIES }o--o{ ACTING : "has several actors"
    MOVIES }o--|| DIRECTING : "allows only one director"
    DIRECTING }o--o{ DIRECTORS : "can direct several movies" 
    MOVIES ||--o{ BOX_OFFICE_RESULTS : "a movie can have several box office results"   

```
Every table has a name and it has columns, that have also a name and optional a data type. I recommend to always use a datatype. So for example in the table movies, there is the column name that has the datatype TEXT. Yes, I said column even though you see rows here. In the ER Diagram we visualize the table with its columns as table with rows. But later, we add data to the table you. Then the names such as id, name, year, rating etc. become columns resp. they become the heading of their columns.

The table movies saves all movies that were in the cinema in the year 2019. We have an id as PRIMARY KEY. Even though the table should only include the movies from the year 2019 I added a column year. I did this because I thought about the case, that we might want to add movies from the year 2018 or 2020. It is easy to implement something like this now then to update the whole table and its entries later.

movies has a relation to box_office_results, acting and directing. It is a 1:n-relation. A movie can have several results from box_office_results because a movie that started in 2019 can still be in the cinema in 2020. To be prepared for a corner case like that I added also a column with year to the table box_office_results. box_office_results has id as PRIMARY KEY and of course movie_id as FOREIGN KEY because of its relation to movies. While a movie can have several results in the box_office_results, a result from box_offices_result can only be associated with one specific movie.

The relation between movies and acting is n:n as well as the relation between actors and acting. A movie has several actors and and actor can be in several movies. The “”link-table” acting the connection between actors and movies. Therefore it has 2 FOREIGN KEYs: movie_id and actor_id. I added also a column called type. Here we will specify if an actor has a leading or a supporting role with the values ‘leading’ or ‘supporting’.

The relation between movies and directing is n:1 and the relation between directing and directors is n:n. A movie should only have one director. But a director can make several movies. I could have saved the director directly in the movies table. But there maybe could be the case that a movie is for some reason directed by 2 directors. That would change the relation between movies and directing to n:n. But we could work with it without any additional changes in the database.

I hope now, that you became and understanding of why it is important to think about corner cases or additional data such as movies from another year you might want or need to add in the future.

## Installing SQLite
Now that the concept is clear, we finally can start to work with SQLite. If you want to code along with me or try to create your very own exampled, you need to have SQLite installed on your computer:
1. Go to https://www.sqlite.org/index.html
2. Download and unzip it
3. Save it in the folders where you want create you SQL projects

To work with SQL you need a terminal. I recommend using VSCode (Visual Studio Code). You can open a terminal in VSCode with Terminal -> New Terminal.

## Creating a database with SQLite
We can start and end SQL with the following commands:

```
-- start a connection to the datbase movies_2019.db
SQLite3 movies_2019.db

-- end the connection to the database
.quit
```

You can name your database of course however you prefer. The first time you want to connect to a database, SQL might ask you if you want to create the database.

I always work with an extra SQL (somefile.sql). It is more comfortable to write SQL there and just copy it into the terminal. But you don’t need to do that.

We can create a table with CREATE TABLE.

```
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    columnname1 DATATYPE,
    columnname2 DATATYPE
);
```

CREATE TABLE is followed by the name of you table (not the database). In the brackets we add the columns, followed by the datatype. Even though, adding a datatype is optional, I recommend to always use a datatype. Every columns besides the last one has to be seperated by a comma. We finish the CREATE TABLE command with a semicolon.

We can and should specify PRIMARY and FOREIGN KEYs:

```
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    id INTEGER,
    columnname2 DATATYPE,
    othertable_id DATATYPE,
    columnname3 DATATYPE,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (othertable_id) REFERENCES othertable (id)
);
```

PRIMARY KEY (id) specifies that id is the PRIMARY. Since id has the datatype INTEGER SQL knows now that you want an id with autoincrement. That means, every time you add an entry to your table, SQL looks in the table what the highest id is and saves the new entry with (highest found id + 1) as value for id.

If you delete an entry in your table, SQL will not fill this id again. It always choose the next value after the highest one. But of course you can add an entry and give it a specific id. We take a look at that in another part of the tutorial. For now we focus on creating the database.
We specify that a column is a FOREIGN KEY with

```
FOREIGN KEY (othertable_id) REFERENCES othertable (id)
```

othertabele_id is the colum in the table your about to create, othertable is the name of the othertable you build a relation to and id is the name of the PRIMARY KEY in the other table.
So let’s give it a try with the table movies.

```
-- start connection to the datbase movies_2019.db
SQLite3 movies_2019.db

-- create table movies 
sqlite> CREATE TABLE movies (
    id INTEGER,
    name TEXT,
    year INTEGER,
    start_date TEXT,
    length INTEGER,
    rating TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- check what is saved in the SQL schema
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE movies (
    id INTEGER,
    name TEXT,
    year INTEGER,
    start_date TEXT,
    length INTEGER,
    rating TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
sqlite> 
```

Congratulations! You know now how to create a database and you added your very first table!
I added all the column with an appropriate datatype as well as the PRIMARY KEY in the CREATE TABLE command. Then I looked up what is saved in the SQL schema with the command .schema and it showed exactly what I typed as result. So I did everything correct, didn’t I? Taking a closer look at the CREATE TABLE command I realise that I create the rating column with the datatype TEXT even though I planned a real here. What now? We can change the CREATE TABLE command and add the correct datatype to the column rating and try to create the table again. But that is not possible. SQL can’t just overwrite the table. If we want to recreate a table completely we have to delete the table first in the schema. For that we need the DROP TABLE command.

```
-- delete table movies from the database
sqlite> DROP TABLE movies;

-- create the table movies again
sqlite> CREATE TABLE movies (
    id INTEGER,
    name TEXT,
    year INTEGER,
    start_date TEXT,
    length INTEGER,
    rating REAL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- check what is saved in the SQL schema
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE movies (
    id INTEGER,
    name TEXT,
    year INTEGER,
    start_date TEXT,
    length INTEGER,
    rating REAL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
sqlite>
```

It seems a little bit harsh to delete the whole table instead of just changing the datatype or deleting only the column adding a new column. But the behaviour of ALTER TABLE needs a bit more explanation and background. Therefor I will cover that in another part of the tutorial.
So let’s create the other tables of our database and then sum up what we covered today.

```
-- create table box office results
sqlite> CREATE TABLE box_office_results (
    id INTEGER,
    year INTEGER,
    movie_id INTEGER,
    national REAL,
    international REAL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (movie_id) REFERENCES movies (id)
);
sqlite>

-- create table actors
sqlite> CREATE TABLE actors (
    id INTEGER,
    first_name TEXT,
    last_name TEXT,
    birth_year INTEGER,
    birth_month INTEGER,
    birth_day INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
sqlite>

-- create table directors
sqlite> CREATE TABLE directors (
    id INTEGER,
    first_name TEXT,
    last_name TEXT,
    birth_year INTEGER,
    birth_month INTEGER,
    birth_day INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
sqlite>

-- create table directing
sqlite> CREATE TABLE directing (
    movie_id INTEGER,
    director_id INTEGER,
    type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('leading', 'supporting')),
    FOREIGN KEY (movie_id) REFERENCES movies (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (director_id) REFERENCES directors (id)
);
sqlite>
```

Checking the SQL schema should result in:

```
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE movies (
    id INTEGER,
    name TEXT,
    year INTEGER,
    start_date TEXT,
    length INTEGER,
    rating REAL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE TABLE box_office_results (
    id INTEGER,
    year INTEGER,
    movie_id INTEGER,
    national REAL,
    international REAL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (movie_id) REFERENCES movies (id)
);
CREATE TABLE actors (
    id INTEGER,
    first_name TEXT,
    last_name TEXT,
    birth_year INTEGER,
    birth_month INTEGER,
    birth_day INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE TABLE directors (
    id INTEGER,
    first_name TEXT,
    last_name TEXT,
    birth_year INTEGER,
    birth_month INTEGER,
    birth_day INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
CREATE TABLE directing (
    movie_id INTEGER,
    director_id INTEGER,
    type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('leading', 'supporting')),
    FOREIGN KEY (movie_id) REFERENCES movies (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (director_id) REFERENCES directors (id)
);
sqlite> 
```

There is one thing I didn’t explain you yet:

```
type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('leading', 'supporting')),
```

With CHECK we can predefine what input values are allowed. In this case the table only accepts the values are ‘leading’ or ‘supporting”. Everything else would end in an error.

## Sum up what we covered today

* SQLite has 6 data types: **TEXT**, **NUMERIC**, **INTEGER**, **REAL**, **BLOB**, **NULL**
* **CREATE TABLE** mytable (colum1, DATATYPE); creates a new table
* **CHECK** can predefine allowed values
* **DROP TABLE** mytable deletes a table from the database
* **SQLite3 mydatabase.db** starts a connection to a database (and creates the database if not created yet)
* **.schema** shows us the tables we have in the database
* **.quit** ends the connection to the database

In Part 3 of we will INSERT data into the movie database and learn how to SELECT with easy and nested queries.

Happy coding.
